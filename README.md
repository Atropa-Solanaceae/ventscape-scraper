# ventscape-scraper
A scraper for the website https://www.ventscape.life/ that gathers the text sent and saves them to a .txt for interest reading 

Running is slightly complicated, it requires the libraries of selenium, PIL, webdriver.manager, and pytesseract. The first three can be installed with a simple pip in command prompt but pytesseract requires installation. A handy source can be found here: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
This program is tested on the 64 bit version of pytesseract, and has not been tested on the 32 bit version

In the future this program will run in the background, hopefully soon I'll get around to updating it
